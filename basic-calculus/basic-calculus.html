		<h2>Basic Calculus</h2>
		<p>This page stores the list of reviews of <i>Basic Calculus</i> courses I had enrolled in. Each element in the list leads to a page that contains my review on the course.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, I haven't participated in any basic calculus courses because I have taken <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/calculusexam/"><strong>Calculus Credit by Examination</strong></a> to <strong>skip</strong> all of the courses.</p>

		<p>You can read more about the exams on the hypertext above. </p>

		<h3>Calculus Credit By Exam?</h3>
		<p>To put it simply, if you already studied these calculus courses (i.e. either from your high school or self-studying), you can take these exams to attain the credit for basic calculus courses. However, <strong>you can take the exam of a course <u>only once</u></strong>. If you failed the exam for a course, you cannot re-take the exam, and you no choice but to enroll in the course.</p>

		<h3>What would the exams be like?</h3>
		<p>The exams are basically the final exams of the calculus courses. The best way to prepare is simply download the past final exams and practice. (They are available on the website above)</p>
