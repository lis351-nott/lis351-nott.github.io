		<h2>COMP SCI 252 - Introduction to Computer Engineering</h2>
		<p>I would not be surprise if you say you have used computers for a really long time, maybe since your childhood.</p>
		<p>With that said, this course's main question is "Do you want to know how the first computer was built?"</p>
		<p>No no, I did not only mean just "how you piece transisters together to create logic gates, which are miniscule but inherent parts of all computers" or "how assembly code works on x86, one of the first <i>complex instruction set computer (CISC)</i>?"</p>
		<p>I also mean "the history of computer". Like, who was the first person to actually create something that resembles a computer? What was defined to be a "computer" in the past?
		<p>This class might look boring because you won't know how all of these are related to understanding how "modern computers" work until MUCH later in the curriculum.</p>
		<p>However, I guarantee you that this class is really important to build your mental image on how computer, the machine you have been using for who knows how long, actually functions.</p>
		<p>If you slack off on this course, you are gonna feel it in <strong>COMP SCI 354</strong>, the sequel of this one.</p>
