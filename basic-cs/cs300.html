		<h2>COMP SCI 300/400 - Programming</h2>
		<p>In this course, you got to learning the basics of programming through <strong>Java</strong>. The basics here include, but not limited to,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>primitive data types and their wrappers</li>
			<li>object oriented programming (i.e. objects, classes, inheritance, etc)</li>
			<li>if-else, for loop, switch</li>
			<li>Some basic data structures (i.e. linked lists, binary search trees, skip list, etc)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you already have some programming experience before, these two class are very good reviews for the core fundamental concepts of programming</p>
		<p>However, with that said, if you are already familiar with these concepts, these classes are going to be very boring. You might be given some group projects to work on, but they are still far apart from what people really use on real projects nowadays.</p>
