		<h2>COMP SCI 559 - Computer Graphics</h2>
		<p>Have you watched <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">Frozen</a></i> (2013)?</p>
		<p>Are you following any Vtubers right now?</p>
		<p>Ever since when I was a kid, I have watched a lot of computer-animated films, including <i>Monster Inc</i> (2001), <i>Toy Story</i> (1995, 1999, 2010, 2019), <i>Finding Nemo</i> (2003), and <i>Kung Fu Panda</i> (2018).</p>

		<p>I was fascinated by those movies, and become even more interested after I learn how to program, even more fascinated after the appearance of Vtubers.</p>

		<p>"So, are you saying this course is about the history and how to create those graphics?". Well, yes.</p>

		<p>"Oh! Does that mean we are going learn how to use <i>Blender</i> or <i>Maya</i>?" No. We will go <strong>beyond</strong> that. We are not going to learn how to use <i>Blender</i> to create graphics nor animations, but <strong>we are going to learn how <i>Blender</i> are written.</strong></p>

		<p>Okay, that was a bit exaggerated, but I hope you get the idea. In this course, we are going to learn how to communicate with computer hardware to "draw" things on the screen for us.</p>

		<p>You will have a very sharp granularity in controlling what will be drawn on the screen, even down to a single pixel.</p>

		<p>However, you <strong>need</strong> to learn how to "orchestrate" what and where to appears on the screen so that it matches you have imagined.</p>

		<p>Learning how to "orchestrate" include, but not limited to,</p>

		<ul>
			<li>How to represent "points", "lines" or "shapes"?</li>
			<li>What does it mean to "rotate", "scale" and "transform"?</li>
			<li>How do you define "curves"? What are the advantages and drawbacks for each techniques?</li>
			<li><strong>lots</strong> of linear algebra</li>
			<li>How do you all of the above in three dimensions?</li>
			<li>How do you "paint" the surface of an object? How do you use that "painting" to create an illusion that a smooth object has bumps?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>By the end of the course, you will gain an insight on the low-level of how computer-animated graphics and Vtubers are created. At that point, you can study more about graphics on your own.</p>

			<p>This is my first project on 3D graphics on the course. Written purely in vanilla JavaScript</p>
		</div>

		<p>We will be using <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the communication in this course. The background of JavaScript is not required prior to the course.</p>

		<p>Do be prepared to write a lot of code. This is a programming course for a reason.</p>
