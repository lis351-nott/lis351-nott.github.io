		<h2>MATH 475 - Introduction to Combinatorics</h2>
		<p>Do you love counting? Do you love counting "how many distinct necklaces that can be created from 2 red beads, 5 blue beads and 1 green beads"? 
		(Spoiler Alert: This is indeed not an easy problem and the solution is not simple. Beware that the necklaces can be "rotated" and "fliped". You will find out how to solve this problem at the final chapter of this course.)</p>

		<p>This is the continuation of what we study about counting in high school.</p>

		<p>However, this time, you are going to dive deep into a lot of hard problems about counting. You are going learn a lot of techniques and tools for counting various things in your life.</p>

		<p>The techniques you will see include, but not limited to,</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Double Counting</li>
			<li>Inclusion Exclusion</li>
			<li>Catalan Number, Bell Number, Stirling Number</li>
			<li>Generating Function</li>
			<li>Pigeonhole Principle</li>
			<li>Burnside's Lemma and Polya Counting</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you can make it to the end, you are going to see the beauty of counting in a new light.</p>
